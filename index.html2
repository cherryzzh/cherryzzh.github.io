	<h2>English version</h2>
	<p>Once upon a time, there was a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest. The villagers had a very unique way of life - they lived in tree houses and relied on nature for everything. They had a deep love and respect for Mother Nature.

One day, a young boy named Jack stumbled upon a lost seed while playing in the forest. He knew it was a rare and precious seed, so he took it to the village elders. They were amazed to see that it was a seed of a magical tree that could grant wishes.

The elders decided to plant the seed in the center of the village, and it soon grew into a beautiful and majestic tree. They named it the wish tree. The villagers would gather around the tree every night, hoping to have their wishes fulfilled.

One night, a greedy and selfish man named George came to the wish tree. He wished for gold and riches beyond measure. To his surprise, the wish tree granted his wish, and his village became the wealthiest.

	<p>从前，在茂密的森林中心有一个小村庄。村民们有一种非常独特的生活方式——他们住在树屋里，一切都依赖大自然。他们对大自然有着深深的爱和尊敬。

一天，一个名叫杰克的小男孩在森林里玩耍时偶然发现了一颗丢失的种子。他知道这是一颗罕见而珍贵的种子，所以他把它带给了村里的长老。他们惊奇地发现，这是一颗可以实现愿望的魔法树的种子。

长老们决定把种子种在村庄的中心，很快它就长成了一棵美丽而雄伟的树。他们把它命名为愿望树。村民们每天晚上都会聚集在这棵树周围，希望他们的愿望能够实现。

		一天晚上，一个名叫乔治的贪婪自私的人来到愿望树前。他希望得到无限的黄金和财富。令他惊讶的是，许愿树实现了他的愿望，他的村庄变成了最富有的村庄</p>
