	<h1>Hello! I will talk about what is AI and what is self-driving cars</h1>
	<p>By: Cherry Zeng&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is AI?</h2>
	<p>Artificial intelligence, also known as omniscience and machine intelligence, refers to the intelligence shown by machines made by humans. Generally artificial intelligence refers to the technology that presents human intelligence through ordinary computer programs.</p>
	<h2>What are self-driving cars?</h2>
<p>According to ucsusa.org, Self-driving vehicles are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or “driverless” cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.</p>
	<h2>Why is self-driving cars popular and nice?</h2>
	<p>1. Prevention of car crashes
Of the 37,133 vehicle fatalities in 2017, 94% of the crashes were due to human error. Computers based on sophisticated systems and algorithms will essentially eliminate costly human error. Major causes of accidents, including drunk or distracted driving, will not be factors with self-driving cars. It’s estimated self-driving cars can reduce accidents by up to 90%.

<p>2. Societal cost-savings
One of the major factors when weighing the pros and cons of automated cars is the cost to society. Reports have shown that autonomous vehicles can help save society approximately $800 billion each year. The reduction in car crash-related costs, reduced strain on the healthcare system, more efficient transportation, better fuel savings, and more can all contribute to the overall societal cost-savings.</p>

<p>3. Traffic efficiency
One of the major benefits of self-driving cars is their ability to communicate with each other. With this ability to communicate in real-time, cars would be able to travel efficiently at optimized distances from each other. They’d also determine the best route for you to take, as to eliminate bumper-to-bumper traffic jams.</p>

<p>4. Better access and mode of transportation
For those who cannot or choose not to drive, self-driving cars could be a safe and reliable mode of transportation. Those with a disability or the elderly would be able to get into a self-driving car without putting others at risk. Cities with limited public transit coverage would also benefit from self-driving cars. Self-driving cars can easily reach areas where infrastructure is lacking.</p>

<p>5. Environmentally friendly
Another significant factor in the self-driving cars pros and cons debate is the environment. Autonomous cars will likely be electric rather than utilizing internal-combustion engines. Furthermore, the consistent speeds self-driving cars will be traveling at will reduce constant braking and accelerating. These factors will all contribute to reducing emissions and becoming more environmentally sustainable.</p>
